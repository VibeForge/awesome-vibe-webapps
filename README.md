## What is Vibe Coding?

_Vibe Coding_ is an AI-powered programming method where users describe what they want in natural language, and AI generates the code. Introduced by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, it’s designed to be accessible for non-experts and excels at quick prototyping with tools like Replit Agent and Cursor Composer. ~~However, experts caution about its reliability for professional use due to potential bugs and maintenance challenges.~~
