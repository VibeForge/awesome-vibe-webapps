# Contributing to VibeForge awesome-vibe-webapps

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **VibeForge awesome-vibe-webapps** repository! This project is a curated collection of web applications built with creative, experimental "vibe coding" approaches, and it thrives on community contributions. We welcome you to share your own webapp or any inspiring webapp you've discovered, as long as it embodies creativity and a unique vibe.

## How to Contribute

**1. Fork the Repository**  
Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository page to create your own copy of the project. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

**2. Clone and Create a Branch**  
Clone your fork to your local machine (or use GitHub's web editor if you prefer not to use the command line). Then create a new branch for your contribution. For example, you might name it `add-my-webapp` or `add-<webapp-name>`. Creating a separate branch makes it easier to manage your changes and submit a focused pull request.

**3. Add Your Webapp Entry**  
Open the repositoryâ€™s main listing file (usually `README.md` or a dedicated list file) and add your webapp details following the **Formatting Guidelines** below. Make sure the webapp you are adding aligns with the vibe coding spirit (i.e., it's creative, experimental, and built enterely using vibe coding AI tools, e.g, Cursor Composer, Windsurf, Manus, etc.). Include all the required fields (title, description, link, etc.) in the proper format. If you're unsure, you can copy the format of an existing entry and modify it with your webapp's information.

**4. Commit Your Changes**  
After adding your entry, commit your changes. Use a clear and descriptive commit message, such as `Add [WebApp Name]` or `Add [WebApp Name] to list`. This helps maintainers understand the purpose of the commit at a glance. You can provide more detail in the commit description if necessary (for example, why the webapp is useful or any notable details).

**5. Open a Pull Request**  
Push your branch to your fork on GitHub. Then, go to your repository page on GitHub and you should see a prompt to open a pull request (PR) from your new branch. Click "Compare & Pull Request." In the PR description, briefly explain your contribution â€” what webapp you added and why itâ€™s a great addition. Then submit the pull request.

**6. Participate in the Review**  
A project maintainer will review your pull request. They might suggest changes or ask questions (for example, to adjust formatting or clarify the description). This is a normal part of the process! Engage in the discussion politely and make any necessary updates by pushing new commits to your branch. We encourage you to ask questions if anything is unclear â€” we're here to help you make your contribution awesome.

**7. Merge and Celebrate**  
Once your contribution meets the guidelines and any feedback has been addressed, a maintainer will merge your pull request into the main repository. ðŸŽ‰ *Thank you!* Youâ€™ve just contributed to the VibeForge awesome-vibe-webapps project. You (and others) will now be able to see your added webapp in the list. 

*Note: If you are new to Git/GitHub or unsure about the pull request process, you can alternatively open an issue with the details of the webapp you want to add. One of the maintainers can assist by adding it for you or guiding you through the process.*

## Formatting Guidelines

To keep the list organized and consistent, please follow these formatting rules when submitting a webapp:

- **Title**: The name of the web application.  
  - Use the official or common name of the app.  
  - Capitalize each word appropriately (for example, use **"My Cool App"** instead of **"my cool app"**).

- **Description**: A short description of the webapp (ideally 1-2 sentences).  
  - Explain what the app does or what makes it special, especially highlighting its *vibe* or creative aspect.  
  - Be concise and positive. For example, you might mention the appâ€™s main purpose or a standout feature.  
  - Use a third-person perspective and present tense (e.g., "Displays random quotes on a calming background" instead of "This app will display...").  
  - Avoid overly promotional language or subjective praise (let the readers decide what's "awesome").

- **Link**: The direct URL to the webapp.  
  - Use a complete URL, preferably starting with `https://`.  
  - Double-check that the link is correct and the site is accessible. Broken links or incorrect URLs canâ€™t be merged.

- **Tags (Optional)**: A few keywords that categorize the webapp.  
  - Tags can indicate the tech stack, genre, or vibe of the project. Examples: `React`, `Vue`, `AI`, `game`, `art`, `retro`, `minimalist`.  
  - Include 1-3 relevant tags that give readers a quick idea of what to expect.  
  - Format: list the tags in parentheses at the end of the description, each separated by a comma. For example: *(Tags: music, creative, chill vibes)*.

- **Release date**: A release date for your webapp on this platform following the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g., `2025-03-11` for March 11th, 2025.

**Example of a well-formatted entry:**  
```markdown
- [My Awesome App](https://myawesomeapp.example) - A fun webapp that plays chill music while you browse art. *(Tags: music, creative, chill vibes)* - 2025-03-11
```

In this example:  
- **My Awesome App** is the Title (and also a link to the webapp).  
- The description *"A fun webapp that plays chill music while you browse art."* tells readers what the app is about and hints at its vibe.  
- The tags *music, creative, chill vibes* give a bit more context about the app's category or feel.

Before submitting, please **check existing entries** to see how they are formatted. Consistency is key:
- Add your entry in the correct section if the list is categorized (or in alphabetical order if the list is alphabetical).
- Make sure spacing, punctuation, and styling match the rest of the document (for instance, use the same bullet style `-` or `*` as the rest of the list).
- Ensure your description is succinct and informative. If itâ€™s too long, consider trimming it to the essentials.

Finally, proofread your entry for any typos or formatting issues (a missing bracket, etc.). Taking a moment to review helps speed up the review process and makes it easier for maintainers to accept your contribution.

## Code of Conduct

Our goal is to maintain a **welcoming, positive, and creative** community. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the following code of conduct. This is to ensure that everyone, especially newcomers, feels safe and encouraged to contribute.

- **Be Respectful and Kind:** Treat all fellow contributors with respect. Disagreements and differing opinions are okay, but **harassment, personal attacks, or disrespectful comments are not acceptable**. Always assume the best intentions in othersâ€™ communications and respond kindly.

- **Positive Engagement:** Keep conversations constructive and positive. Celebrate creativity and successes â€“ if someone shares a new webapp or idea, acknowledge the effort. When giving feedback, do it constructively. For example, instead of saying "This description is bad," you could say, "I think you could make the description clearer by mentioning the main feature earlier."

- **Inclusivity:** We welcome contributors of all experience levels, backgrounds, and identities. No matter if youâ€™re a veteran developer or making your first ever pull request, you are welcome here. Help us maintain an inclusive environment by being patient and supportive. **Hateful or exclusionary language** of any kind (related to gender, race, religion, orientation, etc.) will not be tolerated.

- **Collaboration and Creativity:** Encourage others and support new ideas. VibeForge awesome-vibe-webapps projects are all about creative, sometimes unconventional approaches â€“ embrace that! If you have suggestions to improve someoneâ€™s contribution, frame it as help. For instance, "This is a cool idea. Maybe we can also add X to make it even better?" Collaboration works best when everyone feels their ideas are valued.

- **No Spam or Self-Promotion Abuse:** We love to see your projects, but ensure that any webapp you submit truly provides value or inspiration to others. Avoid repeatedly promoting the same project or anything off-topic. Every contribution should be in the spirit of sharing genuinely interesting or useful webapps.

If you witness behavior that violates these guidelines, or if someone makes you feel unwelcome, please reach out to the maintainers. We take code of conduct issues seriously and will address problems to uphold a positive community. 

_By contributing to this repository, you agree to this Code of Conduct and understand that maintainers have the right to moderate and manage contributions or discussions to ensure a safe environment._

## Community and Discussions

We encourage **meaningful discussions** and **constructive feedback** in our community. Whether you're opening an issue, commenting on a pull request, or chatting in discussion threads, please keep these principles in mind:

- **Ask Questions Freely:** If you're curious or unsure about something, just ask! There's no such thing as a dumb question. If an aspect of a webapp or the contribution process confuses you, open an issue or comment and someone will be happy to help. We were all beginners once.

- **Share Ideas and Suggestions:** Have an idea to improve the project or a webapp entry? Great! Share it in an issue or PR comment. Explain your suggestion clearly and **focus on the improvement** rather than any perceived shortcoming. For example, "I love this webapp link! Perhaps we could add a tag for `education` since it teaches coding?".

- **Give Constructive Feedback:** When reviewing others' contributions, aim to help, not hinder. If something can be better, kindly point it out along with a rationale or example. Remember to acknowledge what the contributor did well, too. For instance: "This addition is awesome, thank you! One minor tweak: the description could be a bit shorter to match the style of others â€” maybe remove the last sentence for brevity."

- **Stay Open-Minded:** In discussions, you might encounter opinions or creative styles different from your own. Be open-minded and consider those perspectives. Even if you disagree, you can still provide feedback in a civil way or agree to disagree. Our focus is on improving the project, not "winning" an argument.

- **Keep it Friendly:** Tone can be hard to read in text. Before posting, read over your words and ensure they sound friendly and helpful. Adding a polite phrase or emoji ðŸ˜Š can help convey warmth. We want communication here to put people at ease and encourage more participation.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a fun and inspiring environment where everyone feels empowered to contribute their creative webapp ideas!

## Getting Help

We want the contribution process to be easy to follow, even if you've never done it before. Here are some resources and tips if you need help:

- **GitHub Basics:** New to GitHub? You might find it useful to read the official guides on [Forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). These step-by-step guides will walk you through forking the project, making changes, and submitting a pull request.

- **Ask the Community:** If any step in the process is unclear, feel free to open an issue to ask for help. You can also search previous issues to see if someone had a similar question. Weâ€™re a friendly bunch and happy to assist!

- **Learn by Example:** It might help to look at existing pull requests in this repository to see how others have formatted their contributions and how the review process went. This can give you a sense of what to expect.

- **Contact Maintainers:** If you need to reach out to the maintainers directly for any reason (for example, to report a sensitive issue or ask a question privately), you can find our contact information in the repository or in the Code of Conduct above.
